# Computer-Vision
This repository contains traditional algorithms for computer vision tasks.

1. shape from shading and Image alignment: 
The input to the algorithm is a set of photographs taken with known lighting directions and the
output of the algorithm is the albedo (paint), normal directions, and the height map

2.Color image demosicing using Interpolation techniques

3. Keypoint detection and panromic stitching

4. CNN on MNIST
